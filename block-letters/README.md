# Block Letters ASCII Art Generator

## Description

The provided JavaScript code defines a function called `asciiArt` designed to generate ASCII art for a given input word using a specified character. The code also includes an object named `letters` that stores ASCII art representations for uppercase letters A to Z. Here's a breakdown of how the code operates:

- The `asciiArt` function takes two parameters: `word` (representing the input text) and `character` (indicating the character to use for creating ASCII art).

- It ensures consistency by converting the input `word` to uppercase, facilitating uniform ASCII art representation.

- To validate input, the function checks if the `character` is a single character (with a length equal to 1). If it's not, an error message is displayed, and the function returns `false`.

- The `letters` object contains ASCII art representations for uppercase letters A to Z.

- The function iterates through each letter in the input `word`. If the letter exists in the `letters` object, it appends the corresponding ASCII art representation to the `asciiArtText` variable. However, if the letter is not found, spaces are used as a placeholder, and an error message is logged.

- Finally, the complete ASCII art for the input `word` is printed to the console.

The code example concludes by defining an input word ("ASCII") and a character ("#") and then calling the `asciiArt` function with these values to generate and display the ASCII art for the word "ASCII."

## Outcomes

Upon executing the code with the provided input values, the following outcomes are observed:

- The code generates an ASCII art representation of the word "ASCII" using the specified character "#" as the building block.

- Each uppercase letter in the word "ASCII" is displayed as a block using the specified character, creating a visually appealing representation.

- In cases where a letter is not found in the `letters` object (e.g., when using lowercase letters or non-alphabet characters in the input word), an error message is logged for that particular letter. However, spaces are employed as placeholders in the ASCII art.

- The final ASCII art, a combination of individual ASCII art representations of each letter in the word "ASCII" concatenated together, is printed to the console.
